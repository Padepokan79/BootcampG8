-----------------------------

1.obtain the names of all Phsycian that have performed a medician procedure they have never been certified to perform

SELECT DISTINCT physician.`Name`
from physician , trained_in
where physician.EmployeeID not in (SELECT trained_in.Physician from trained_in);

2.Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on.
 SELECT DISTINCT physician.`Name` , procedures.`Name` , trained_in.CertificationDate 
	from physician , trained_in , procedures 
	where physician.EmployeeID not in (SELECT trained_in.Physician from trained_in) 
	and trained_in.Treatment = procedures.`Code`;

3.-Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure that they are certified to perform, but such that the procedure was done at a date (Undergoes.Date) after the physician's certification expired (Trained_In.CertificationExpires).
	
	SELECT DISTINCT physician.`Name`
FROM undergoes , procedures , physician , trained_in
WHERE undergoes.Physician = physician.EmployeeID 
	and undergoes.Procedures = procedures.`Code` 
		and undergoes.DateUndergoes > trained_in.CertificationExpires;	

4.Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on, and date when the certification expired.	

	SELECT DISTINCT physician.`Name` , procedures.`Name` ,trained_in.CertificationDate as tanggal , patient.`Name` ,trained_in.CertificationExpires
FROM undergoes , procedures , physician , trained_in , patient
WHERE undergoes.Physician = physician.EmployeeID 
	and undergoes.Procedures = procedures.`Code` 
		and undergoes.DateUndergoes > trained_in.CertificationExpires;		
5.-Obtain the information for appointments where a patient met with a physician other than his/her primary care physician. Show the following information: Patient name, physician name, nurse name (if any), start and end time of appointment, examination room, and the name of the patient's primary care physician.

SELECT DISTINCT patient.`Name` as Pasien, physician.`Name` as Dokter , nurse.`Name` as Suster , appointment.`Start` as mulai , appointment.`End` as berakhir , appointment.ExaminationRoom
FROM patient , physician , appointment , nurse
WHERE appointment.Patient = patient.SSN
	and appointment.Physician = physician.EmployeeID
		and appointment.PrepNurse = nurse.EmployeeID		

6.The Patient field in Undergoes is redundant, since we can obtain it from the Stay table. There are no constraints in force to prevent inconsistencies between these two tables. More specifically, the Undergoes table may include a row where the patient ID does not match the one we would obtain from the Stay table through the Undergoes.Stay foreign key. Select all rows from Undergoes that exhibit this inconsistency.

SELECT DISTINCT patient.`Name`
from patient , undergoes , stay
where patient.SSN = undergoes.Patient
	and undergoes.Stay != stay.StayID
