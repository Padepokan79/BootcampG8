1. Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure they have never been certified to perform.

SELECT
	physician.`Name`
FROM
	undergoes
LEFT JOIN physician ON undergoes.Physician = physician.EmployeeID
WHERE
	undergoes.Procedures NOT IN (
		SELECT
			ti.Treatment
		FROM
			trained_in AS ti
		WHERE
			ti.physician = undergoes.Physician
	)

	------

2. Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on.

SELECT
	physician.`Name`,
	(
		SELECT
			procedures.`Name`
		FROM
			procedures
		WHERE
			procedures.`Code` = undergoes.Procedures
	) AS "Procedure Name",
	undergoes.DateUndergoes AS "Date",
	(
		SELECT
			patient.`Name`
		FROM
			patient
		WHERE
			patient.SSN = undergoes.Patient
	) AS "Patient Name"
FROM
	undergoes
LEFT JOIN physician ON undergoes.Physician = physician.EmployeeID
WHERE
	undergoes.Procedures NOT IN (
		SELECT
			ti.Treatment
		FROM
			trained_in AS ti
		WHERE
			ti.physician = undergoes.Physician
	)

3. Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure that they are certified to perform, but such that the procedure was done at a date (Undergoes.Date) after the physician's certification expired (Trained_In.CertificationExpires).

SELECT
	physician.`Name`
FROM
	undergoes
LEFT JOIN physician ON undergoes.Physician = physician.EmployeeID
WHERE
	undergoes.Procedures IN (
		SELECT
			ti.Treatment
		FROM
			trained_in AS ti
		WHERE
			ti.physician = undergoes.Physician
		AND undergoes.DateUndergoes > (
			SELECT
				ti.CertificationExpires
			FROM
				trained_in AS ti
			WHERE
				ti.Physician = undergoes.Physician
			AND ti.Treatment = undergoes.Procedures
		)
	)
GROUP BY
	physician.`Name`
